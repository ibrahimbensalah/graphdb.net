# graphdb.net
Object Graph Mapper for .NET

Minimal Valueable Product:
1. Graph Model in dotnet
2. Persistence:
   * Create Update Graph
   * Object Model to Graph Model mapping
   * Object Reference to Graph Relation mapping

Roadmap:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Querying with Grimlin
- Linq query support on Graph Model
- Linq query support on Object Model
